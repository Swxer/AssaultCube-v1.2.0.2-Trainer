AssaultCube trainer will allow you to hack AssaultCube with infinite HP, ammo and grenade. 
This trainer will only work for AssaultCube v1.2.0.2. 

To get the executable, go to `/Application/x86` for 32-bit and `/Application/x64` for 64 bit.
The executable must be present in the folder. If you want it outside the folder, make a shortcut.

If you are curious about what memory addresses are being used, the Cheat Engine table is also
supplied and it contain pointers for health, ammo and grenade. 

# Note
The trainer works on my machine and it should work for yours. If not then it is what it is :^)

The trainer may not work or have unexpected behaviour and these might happen in your game:
  * When you click on the checkbox and the corresponding element do not update,
    then there must be something wrong with the memory address when writing 
    something to it. Sometimes restarting the game will do the trick.
  * If you checked and unchecked the health and ammo, the values will go down normally.
    If you somehow checked the grenade, the health will never change regardless it is unchecked.
  * If you only checked and unchecked health, and try to harm yourself with grenade at 9999 hp,
    it seems that it would update the health with specific value rather than subtracting.
    
    
I probably won't be touching or making changes to this ever again but this is definitely a fun project.
