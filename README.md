AssaultCube trainer will allow you to hack AssaultCube with infinite HP, ammo and grenade. 
This trainer will only work for AssaultCube v1.2.0.2. 

To get the executable, go to `/Application/x86` for 32-bit and `/Application/x86` for 64 bit.
The executable must be present in the folder. If you want it outside the folder, make a shortcut.

# Note
The trainer works on my machine and it should work for yours. If not then it is what it is :^)

The trainer may not work and these following might happen:
  * When you click on the checkbox and the corresponding element do not update,
    then there must be something wrong with the memory address when writing 
    something to it. Sometimes restarting the game will do the trick
  * If you checked and unchecked the health and ammo, the values will go down normally.
    If you somehow checked the grenade, the health will never change regardless it is unchecked
    
I probably won't be touching this ever again but this is definitely a fun project.
